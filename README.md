### How to Use

1. Install Python from <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.2/python-3.9.2-amd64.exe">here</a>. It is super important that checkbox `Add Python to PATH` is checked on setup.
2. After Python is installed, you need to install the required modules that are used for this script. 
3. Open the file called `Install Requirements.bat`. This will do everything for you with no issues, simple.
4. Open the `tiktok.py` file with Python.

2. This Python project is simply an automator with selenium for a website I do not own.
3. This script was made for educational purposes
